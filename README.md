# Full Stack Mobile Tech Exercise
## Project Description
Create a photo viewer app which used arbitrary photo sharing service.

## Statements
Please assume some user's problem or desire and develop an app to solve or satisfy it.

For example, you can assume a user who wants to see a lot of photos of delicious dishes. Then you can develop a photo viewer app to search photos of dishes.

When designing the app, keep in mind what you think is useful for the users. Whether it’s the kind of information displayed to the user or the overall experience, be mindful of the user. As an example, an easy installation process could be seen as very useful for users. Going a different direction, focusing on the app’s overall ease of use could be seen as useful.

## Requirements
There is no deadline, but ideally the product should be completed in 2 days. Design your app that it has two or three screens for main feature. Implement both iOS/Android app and API following the teck stacks. It is no problem that the data from the backend is static created by a seed file. However, we don’t accept the data hard-coded in the React Native repository.

Add the codebases for App to the `mobile` directory and add the codebases for API to the `backend` directory

### Tech stacks
- App: Expo
- APIs: Ruby on Rails

## Presentation
- An easy to understand description of your app
  - The target user's problem or desire you assumed (Required)
  - How does your app solve or satisfy it (Required)
  - Any other strengths of your app
- The source code should be buildable
- If your product is running on Android, send your work as an apk file
- Please archive some documents and source codes to ZIP file and upload to this site.
  - Please add a README about how to set up and run your app/APIs code  in the Cookpad side

Don't upload your answer to public space (e.g. GitHub).

## How to evaluate
We’ll check whether the app and APIs work together first of all. But we’re more keen on how to design your codebase. We don’t mind you use an AI assistant for coding assignment. However, we DO mind why you choose the architecture/design of your code. We have no choice but to give huge minus points when we hear “I don’t remember” from you on the tech interview.
